# DeckTrix

## Description

**DeckTrix** is a small collection of various card games that can be enjoyed solo or with friends. This project is designed to be modular and scalable, allowing for the addition of new games and decks in the future.

This project is part of my personal journey to reinforce and practice everything I've learned during the XarxatecActiva 2024 course.

- **Customizable decks**: Create and use different decks (Spanish, French, etc.) depending on the game you want to play.
- **User-friendly interface**: Easy to use and understand for both novice and experienced players.

## Technologies Used

- **TypeScript**: Ensuring clean and scalable code.
- **Node.js**: To run the project and manage dependencies.
